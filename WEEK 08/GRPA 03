'''
filename is a CSV file that has the following header:

Name,Country,Goals
The first five lines of a sample file are given below:

Name,Country,Goals                                        
P1,Brazil,20  
P2,Argentina,30
P3,Brazil,50                                                   
P4,Germany,30
Write a function named get_goals that accepts filename and the name of a country as arguments. It should return a tuple having two elements: (num_players, num_goals). num_players is the number of players from this country that appear in this file, num_goals is the total number of goals scored by all the players who belong to this country. If the country is not present in the file, then return the tuple (-1, -1).

(1) filename is a string variable that holds the name of the file. For example, in the first test case, it is filename = 'public_1.csv'.

(2) Each player who represents a country has scored at least one goal. That is, the last column in the file will have only positive integers.

(3) You do not have to accept input from the user or print the output to the console. You just have to write the function definition.
